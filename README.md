The Iris dataset consists of measurements of various attributes of three different species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The attributes or features measured in the dataset are as follows:

Sepal length (in centimeters)
Sepal width (in centimeters)
Petal length (in centimeters)
Petal width (in centimeters)
For each species of iris, 50 samples were collected, resulting in a total of 150 samples in the dataset.

The Iris dataset is commonly used to demonstrate classification algorithms, particularly for implementing algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and others.
